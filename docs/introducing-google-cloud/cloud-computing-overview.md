# Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits.

1. get computing resources (processing power, storage, network) that are on-demand and self-service (no need for human intervention) through web interface.
2. get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection.
3. has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool
4. the resources are elastic–which means they’re flexible.
5. pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go.
