# IaaS and PaaS

### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

* provide raw compute, storage and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers.
* customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time.

### PaaS - Platform as a Service

* bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure that the application needs. This allows more resources to be focused on application logic.
* customers pay for the resources they actually use.

As cloud computing has evolved, the momentum has shifted towards managed infrastructure and managed services.

* concentrate more on their business goals
* spend less time and money on creating and maintaining their technical infrastructure.
* deliver products and services to their customers more quickly and reliably.

### Serverless

allows developers to concentrate on their code, rather than on server configuration, by eliminating the need for any infrastructure management.
