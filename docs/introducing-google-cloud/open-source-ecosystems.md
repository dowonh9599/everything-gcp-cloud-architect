# Open-source Ecosystems

Google publishes key elements of technology using open source licenses to create ecosystems that provide customers with options other than Google.

* TensorFlow, an open source software library for machine learning developed inside Google, is at the heart of a strong open source ecosystem.
* Kubernetes and Google Kubernetes Engine give customers the ability to mix and match microservices running across different clouds.
