# The Google Cloud Network

This network is designed to give customers wit highest possible throughput and lowest possible latencies for their applications by leveraging more than 100 content caching nodes worldwide.

* high demand content is cached for quicker access, allowing applications to respond to user requests from the location that will provide the quickest response time.
* multiple locations affects applications with qualities like availability, durability, and latency, the latter of which measures the time a packet of information takes to travel from its source to its destination.

Google Cloud’s infrastructure is based in five major geographic locations, further divided into several different regions and zones.

* North America
* South America
* Europe
* Asia
* Australia

**Regions**: independent geographic areas and are composed of zones.

**Zone**: an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed.

Some of Google Cloud’s services support placing resources in what we call a **multi-region**.

* Cloud Spanner: multi-region configurations allow you to replicate the database's data not just in multiple zones, but in multiple zones across multiple regions, as defined by the instance configuration.&#x20;
  * enable you to read data with low latency from multiple locations close to or within the regions in the configuration, like The Netherlands, and Belgium.

Google Cloud currently supports 103 zones in 34 regions.
